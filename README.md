            <p class="hero_paragraph"> The history said that she was called the goddess of the infinite multiverses and the stars, because they are infinite, countless and uncontrollable. She left her mark wherever she went and taught that even in the darkness one shines more brightly as a star. She personifies wisdom, strategy, just war, perseverance and victory. Legend has it that Bebita was the most awaited goddess of the stars and the infinite multiverses, born into a family that already loved her even without knowing that she was coming, always inspired and supported her to be what she decided to be, always reminding her << The universes are infinite, the possibilities are infinite, what you can achieve is infinite >>. With her unlimited power and influence, she acted as an aid to many mythological figures. She is the protective goddess of all multiverses.</p>
